    "summary": "Inventory p95 latency spiked sharply while traffic stayed stable, suggesting backend contention rather than load. Most likely causes are DB lock contention or a slow query regression. Check DB locks, slow query logs, and recent deploys to inventory-service.",
    "root_cause_hypothesis": "DB lock contention or slow query regression in inventory-service",
    "next_steps": "1) Check active DB locks and long-running queries. 2) Compare p95 latency by endpoint_group. 3) Review last deployment and feature flags. 4) Mitigate by scaling read replicas or rolling back if needed.",
